= Query vector data with CQL

To query data using Vector Search, use a `SELECT` query: 

[tabs]
====
CQL::
+
--
[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/sai/select-vsearch-cycling.cql[]
----
--
Result::
+
--
[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/sai/select-vsearch-cycling.result[]
----
--
====

[NOTE]

The limit has to be 1,000 or fewer.

Scrolling to the right on the results shows the comments from the table that most closely matched the embeddings used for the query.
