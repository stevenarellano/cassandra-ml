= `set` column
:description: Use the set data type to store unordered multiple items.

A `set` consists of a unordered group of elements with unique values.
Duplicate values will not be stored distinctly.
The values of a `set` are stored unordered, but will return the elements in sorted order when queried.
Use the `set` data type to store data that has a many-to-one relationship with another column.
